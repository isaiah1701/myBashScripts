- **`fileAnalyse.sh`** - Advanced file analysis and reporting
- **`fileRead.sh`** - File reading and processing utilities
- **`lineCount.sh`** - Simple line counting utility

### üåê Network Administration

#### **Network Scanning**
- **`pingIP.sh`** - Scans IP range (1-254) and identifies live hosts
- **`pingIP2.sh`** - Enhanced IP scanner with better reporting
- **`IPcheck.sh`** - Alternative IP connectivity checker

#### **Port Management**
- **`openPort.sh`** - Checks if specific ports are open on localhost

### üîß Development & Utilities

- **`makeScript.sh`** - Creates new executable script files with proper permissions
- **`numPrint.sh`** - Simple number printing utility (demonstrates loop constructs)

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Monitor Disk Usage
```bash
./dfUse.sh
# Output: Warns if any filesystem exceeds 90% usage
```

### Scan Network Range
```bash
./pingIP.sh 192.168.1
# Scans 192.168.1.1 through 192.168.1.254
```

### Check Service Status
```bash
./serviceCheck.sh nginx /var/log/service.log
# Monitors nginx service and logs status
```

### Analyze Apache Logs
```bash
./apacheLog.sh /var/log/apache2/access.log
# Shows top 5 IP addresses by request count
```

### Check File Statistics
```bash
./fileChecker2.sh document.txt
# Shows lines, words, and character count
```

## üéØ Use Cases

### **System Administration**
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated disk, process, and service monitoring
- **Alerting**: Early warning systems for resource exhaustion
- **Maintenance**: Automated service recovery and restart procedures

### **Security & Compliance**
- **Network Discovery**: Identify active hosts on network segments
- **Log Analysis**: Monitor for errors and security events
- **Port Scanning**: Verify service availability

### **Operations & DevOps**
- **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Real-time system health checks
- **Automation**: Scripted responses to common issues
- **Reporting**: Generate usage and performance reports

### **Development Support**
- **Environment Setup**: Quick script creation utilities
- **Troubleshooting**: Debug system and application issues
- **Performance Analysis**: Memory and resource usage tracking

## üìã Prerequisites

- **Bash 4.0+**
- **Standard Unix/Linux utilities**: `awk`, `grep`, `wc`, `sort`, `ping`, `nc`
- **systemctl** (for service management scripts)
- **Appropriate permissions** for system monitoring tasks

## üîí Security Notes

- Scripts that modify system state require appropriate privileges
- Network scanning scripts should be used responsibly
- Log monitoring may require read access to system logs
- Service management scripts typically require sudo privileges

## üìà Skill Level

These scripts demonstrate **intermediate beginner** to **intermediate** bash scripting skills, covering:
- Parameter handling and validation
- Error handling and exit codes
- Text processing and pattern matching
- System command integration
- Loop constructs and conditional logic
- File and process manipulation

Perfect for **System Administrator**, **DevOps Engineer**, or **Infrastructure Analyst** roles requiring automation and monitoring capabilities.
